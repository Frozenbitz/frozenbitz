I'm Peter, a PhD researcher in machine learning and embedded systems security at
OTH Regensburg. My work focuses on developing host-based intrusion detection 
systems using anomaly detection techniques tailored for networked industrial 
devices. 

Over at OTHR we are working on the MOTRA testbed for our research on intrusion 
detection and other IDS related research.
